## Complications
**Hash density**
- The number of hashes for two songs of similar length can be wildly different
- The quality of output depends heavily on the number of hashes - i.e. the fidelity
- Hence, we do not have much control over the number of hashes per song and therefore the quality of matching
- Perhaps some sort of normalising function is needed to ensure similar songs output roughly the same number of hashes per min
